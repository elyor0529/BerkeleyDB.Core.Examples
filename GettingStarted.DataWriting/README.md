## GettingStarted.DataWriting

We read the same files and inject them into databases repeatedly in these projects. So, this library helps consolidate those efforts.

**Note:** This library requires you set the DATA_PATH environment variable so it points to the data directory containing the CSV files. 
This path will also be used for the databases.
